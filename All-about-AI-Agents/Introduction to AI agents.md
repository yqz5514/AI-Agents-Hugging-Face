1. AI Agent: It is a **system** that leverages an **AI model** to interact with its environment in order to **achieve a user-defined objective**. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions(often via external tools) to fulfill tasks. In simple way to describe it, an ai model capable of **reasoning**, **planning**, and **interacting with its environment**.

- planning: To decide on the sequence of actions and select appropriate tools needed to fulfill the user’s request.

2. The Brain (AI Model): This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model handles reasoning and planning. It decides which Actions to take based on the situation.

3. The Body (Capabilities and Tools): This part represents everything the Agent is equipped to do.

The scope of possible actions depends on what the agent has been equipped with. For example, because humans lack wings, they can’t perform the “fly” Action, but they can execute Actions like “walk”, “run” ,“jump”, “grab”, and so on.

4. Action: Actions are the steps the Agent takes, while Tools are external resources the Agent can use to perform those actions. Actions are not the same as tools. An action, for instance, can involve the use of multiple Tools to complete.

5. Tools: Tools provide the Agent with the ability to execute actions a text-generation model cannot perform natively, such as making coffee or generating images. The design of the Tools is very important and has a great impact on the quality of your Agent.
